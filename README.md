# From Bits to Algorithms ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡

A personal lab of algorithmic challenges and system-level thinking â€” solving problems from the ground up using **Go** and **JavaScript**.

This repository is structured to help me build deep computer science intuition, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and master both low-level and high-level programming through hands-on coding.

---

## ðŸ§­ Goals

- Train algorithmic thinking from first principles.
- Master **Go** as my primary language and **JavaScript** as a complement.
- Understand computer science deeply â€” from hardware-level operations to software abstractions.
- Practice solving problems without relying on external libraries.
- Apply best practices in design, optimization, and complexity analysis.

---

## ðŸ›  Topics Covered

- Bit manipulation and memory-level thinking
- Data Structures (arrays, stacks, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)
- System Design Exercises
- Big O analysis and performance benchmarks
- Go internals and compiler behavior
- Custom implementations (e.g. linked list, hashmap, etc.)
