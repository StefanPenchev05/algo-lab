# 🧠 From Bits to Algorithms

A full-spectrum training ground for mastering computer science — from hardware logic and bit manipulation to backend systems and cloud architecture — using **Go** and **JavaScript**.

This repo is built to **teach me how to think**, not just how to code.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn Go deeply by solving real-world, low-level to high-level challenges
- Build intuition for system architecture and algorithmic optimization
- Implement all data structures and algorithms **from scratch** (no shortcuts, no libraries)
- Understand memory, CPU behavior, and low-level operations
- Practice security and vulnerability discovery through ethical hacking
- Build backend/cloud-native systems with strong fundamentals
- Apply and analyze **Big O complexity**, optimize iteratively

## 🚦 Challenge Rules

- ✅ No third-party algorithm libraries
- ✅ Measure and document performance (time + space complexity)
- ✅ Write detailed explanations (as comments or in `notes/`)
- ✅ Each challenge has edge case tests
- 🚫 No copy-paste — all logic must be original

---

## 🧠 Learning Principles

- Think bottom-up: simulate what the CPU would do
- Model before code: sketch inputs, outputs, flows
- Fail fast, debug hard: error-driven development
- Optimize last — but understand complexity from the start
- Document what you *learn*, not just what you *solve*
