# 🧠 Algo-Lab

Welcome to my personal training ground for learning how to think like a computer — from the lowest bits to the highest abstractions.

This repository contains a series of **custom-crafted challenges** in algorithmic programming, security, backend/cloud logic, and system design. Each challenge is designed to grow my understanding of computing from the **hardware up to the software**, across **multiple disciplines**, primarily using **Go** and **JavaScript**.

> This is not just about solving problems. It's about understanding the why, the how, and the what-if.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Train my mind to think algorithmically and logically like a machine.
- Master the **Go programming language** through real-world, grounded challenges.
- Understand and implement **core computing principles** without relying on pre-built libraries.
- Explore **system-level thinking**, from CPU to cloud.
- Gain intuition in **performance analysis**, **Big O**, and **optimization patterns**.
- Strengthen knowledge of **data structures**, **ethical hacking**, **string manipulation**, and **backend architecture**.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

Each challenge pulls from a mix of the following domains:

| Area                   | Focus                                                              |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📦 Data Structures      | Implementations from scratch: arrays, trees, stacks, graphs, etc.   |
| 📐 Algorithm Design     | Recursion, DP, greedy, backtracking, simulation, divide & conquer  |
| ✂️ String Manipulation  | Regex, parsers, encodings, compression, pattern matching           |
| 🧬 Bitwise & Memory Ops | Binary logic, shifts, masks, pointer-level logic                   |
| 🧪 Ethical Hacking       | Vulnerability discovery, input fuzzing, buffer overflows, logic flaws |
| ☁️ Cloud & Backend      | Protocols, request routing, socket logic, file serving, RESTful APIs |
| 🧠 System Design        | Architecture, scalability, resilience, fault tolerance             |

## 🧠 Challenge Rules

- ❌ No use of libraries that solve the core problem (e.g., `sort`, `map`, `heap`)
- ✅ Use standard library only for I/O or basic operations
- ✅ Every challenge includes:
  - Clear goal and constraints  
  - Time/space complexity analysis  
  - Explanation of reasoning  
  - Stretch goals for deeper exploration  
- ✅ No AI-generated code. I must **think, write, test, and improve**
- ✅ Failures must be explained, not erased

## 🔬 Learning Method

- 💭 **Think before typing**: Visualize memory layout, pointer flow, and complexity  
- 🧾 **Solve on paper**: For complex tasks, simulate by hand first  
- 🔍 **Review & Refactor**: Always ask, “Can I do better?”  
- 📚 **Study theory alongside practice**: Add notes, references, or edge cases  
- ⏱️ **Benchmark when relevant**: CPU time, memory usage, and performance comparison  

---

## 📚 Challenge Format

Each 2–3 day challenge follows a strict format:

1. **Description + Difficulty**  
2. **Goals**  
3. **Topics Covered**  
4. **Rules** (what I can or can’t use)  
5. **Examples** (input/output)  
6. **Learning Materials**  
7. **Stretch Goals**  
8. **What I should have learned**  

You’ll find these either in challenge folders or documented in the `notes/` directory.

## 📝 Progress & Reflections

Each solved problem includes a write-up:

- What I initially thought  
- What I learned  
- What went wrong  
- What I would do differently next time  

> I treat every failure as part of the curriculum.
